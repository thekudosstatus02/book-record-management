# book-record-management
BookRecordManagement project using one keep record of each book one registered.........
Moto :
1. -> I choose this project to just check my skills over on CRUD operations(i.e. CreateReadUpdateDelete) which are important operations in every single project .
2. ->I also applied User-Authentication and even one can also search a book with its name.

Tools used : 1. Django Framework.
2. Python as a backend language.
3. MySQL database integrated with Django.
3. HTML and CSS as frontend language.
